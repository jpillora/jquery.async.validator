Credits

Thanks to [@posabsolute](https://github.com/posabsolute) as this plugin was originally a fork of [jQuery Validation Engine](https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine) though it has been completely rewritten in OO style and is now more extendable and fully asynchronous. Many features have been added and many have not been reimplemented so I have decided give this project a new name instead of trying to do a massive pull-request that wouldn't be backwards compatible.
